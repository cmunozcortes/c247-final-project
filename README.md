## Creating the environment
Please keep the environment.yml up to date as we use more packages. Instructions
on using these files with Anaconda can be found in the
[Anaconda docs](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file)

## Loading the EEG data
`EEG_loading.ipynb` assumes the .npy files are in under `data` in the top level dir of the repo.
