%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
   The ABSTRACT is to be in fully-justified italicized text, at the top
   of the left-hand column, below the author and affiliation
   information. Use the word ``Abstract'' as the title, in 12-point
   Times, boldface type, centered relative to the column, initially
   capitalized. The abstract is to be in 10-point, single-spaced type.
   Leave two blank lines after the Abstract, then begin the main text.
   Look at previous CVPR abstracts to get a feel for style and length.
\end{abstract}

%%%%%%%%% BODY TEXT
\section{Introduction}
Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) provide a direct path of communication to
measure and record brain activity. BCIs can infer human intent from these
neural activity measurements and allow individuals who have lost motor
functions gain control external devices without movement. %TODO: add citation
% brain-computer interfaces: a gentle introduction by graimann & allison 
This technique is known as motor imagery (MI).

Most BCI methods record electrical signals using electrodes
placed on the surface of the scalp (electroencephalography, EEG), or on the
surface of the cerebral cortex. EEG-based motor imagery (EEG MI) is one of the
most popular techniques in BCI due to its non-invasiness, high temporal
resolution, and portability. %TODO: add citation - brain-machine interfaces
% from motor to mood - shanechi mm.

Decoding of raw EEG signals for motor imagery tasks can be realized through a
variety of methods. These methods can be classify into five main categories:
\begin{enumerate*}
    \item linear classifiers (e.g. support vector machine, SVM),
    \item nonlinear Bayesian classifiers (e.g. hidden Markov models HMM),
    \item nearest neighbor classifiers (e.g. $k$-nearest neighbors, KNN),
    \item neural networks, (e.g. multi-layer perception, MLP), and
    \item combinaton of different methods using boosting or voting
\end{enumerate*} % TODO: add citation - LSTM-based eeg classification... p.wang

Generally, these methods require pre-processing of the data to overcome low
signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) typical of these recordings. %TODO: add citation -
%ML for MEG during speech tasks, kostas et al.
A variety of pre-processing techniques exist to extract useful features from the
data. Popular techniques include cropping, trial averaging, normalization,
band-pass filtering, and spatial transforms such as common spatial patterns
(CSP). One shortcoming of this approach is that the expert knowledge these
techniques require can introduce bias and may reinforce underlying assumptions
about the data. %TODO: add citation - kostas et al again.
In contrast, neural networks have the ability to learn representations of the
raw data without any pre-processing steps and can consider potentially unknown
correlations in the data. %TODO: kostas et al.



% Add the idea below to the conclusions
%In practice, however, this is difficult to achieve. The reason is that
%extracting features to express raw EEG signals in a form suitable for a neural
%network is not a trivial task.

\section{Discussion}

Please refer to the author guidelines on the CVPR 2015 web page for a
discussion of the policy on dual submissions.

Compare the following:\\
\begin{tabular}{ll}

 \verb'$\mathit{conf}_a$' & $\mathit{conf}_a$
\end{tabular}\\
See The \TeX book, p165.

The space after \eg, meaning ``for example'', should not be a
sentence-ending space. So \eg is correct, {\em e.g.} is not.  The provided
\verb'\eg' macro takes care of this.

When citing a multi-author paper, you may save space by using ``et alia'',
shortened to ``\etal'' (not ``{\em et.\ al.}'' as ``{\em et}'' is a complete word.)
However, use it only when there are three or more authors.  Thus, the
following is correct: ``
   Frobnication has been trendy lately.
   It was introduced by Alpher~\cite{Alpher02}, and subsequently developed by
   Alpher and Fotheringham-Smythe~\cite{Alpher03}, and Alpher \etal~\cite{Alpher04}.''

This is incorrect: ``... subsequently developed by Alpher \etal~\cite{Alpher03} ...''
because reference~\cite{Alpher03} has just two authors.  If you use the
\verb'\etal' macro provided, then you need not worry about double periods
when used at the end of a sentence as in Alpher \etal.

For this citation style, keep multiple citations in numerical (not
chronological) order, so prefer \cite{Alpher03,Alpher02,Authors14} to
\cite{Alpher02,Alpher03,Authors14}.

\subsection{Footnotes}

Please use footnotes\footnote {This is what a footnote looks like.  It
often distracts the reader from the main flow of the argument.} sparingly.
Indeed, try to avoid footnotes altogether and include necessary peripheral
observations in
the text (within parentheses, if you prefer, as in this sentence).  If you
wish to use a footnote, place it at the bottom of the column on the page on
which it is referenced. Use Times 8-point type, single-spaced.


%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{References}

List and number all bibliographical references in 9-point Times,
single-spaced, at the end of your paper. When referenced in the text,
enclose the citation number in square brackets, for
example~\cite{Authors14}.  Where appropriate, include the name(s) of
editors of referenced books.

When placing figures in \LaTeX, it's almost always best to use
\verb+\includegraphics+, and to specify the  figure width as a multiple of
the line width as in the example below
{\small\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx} ...
   \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]
                   {myfile.eps}
\end{verbatim}
}

\bibliography{egbib}
